# Death_Event_prediction
The dataset has attributes that are related to death event of a human due to heart attack. An attempt to make a  classification  model to predict the survival rate of the person, has been made.
1) I have done exploratory data analysis on the whole dataset.
2) After which, I have chosen relevant features which are actually correlated to the "death_event" variable, to train and test a classification model.
3) Once the model was trained and tested using various classifiers, the final selected classifier was then converted to a pickle file, to load in a flask application.
4) After creating the basic app for prediction of a person's survival rate, I dockerised the app.
5) Post dockerising, the github link clone is made, which then was uploaded to AWS cloud, for deploying globally so that anyone with the link can open it directly.
IN SUMMARY:
I have made a datascience project which involves EDA, model building, making a flask app, dockerising it and then at last deploying that globally for client(dummy).
